<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello, I am Peiyuan Gong (ÂÖ¨ÂüπÂÖÉ, in Chinese). Feel free to call me Pei Yuan.
I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/index.htm), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Jiaxin Mao](https://sites.google.com/site/maojiaxin/).
Before that, I received M.Eng and B.Eng degrees in Computer Science and Technology from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://bit.edu.cn/) in 2023 and from [Zhengzhou University](http://www.zzu.edu.cn/) in 2020, respectively.

My research focuses on information retrieval and natural language processing, having published several papers 
at the top international AI conferences such as ACL, EMNLP. 
Currently, I am dedicated to exploring the next generation of search engine with large language models.

Please feel free in touch if you are interested in my research work and want to communicate further.
